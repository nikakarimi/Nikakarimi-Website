        <p class="lead mb-4">Hello, Hello, my name is Nika Karimi and I am aspiring to be a future dentist. Right now I am currently a student at the University of California, Riverside. I am a second year student, almost a third year, and have really been focusing on my schooling up to this point. I recently decided last summer that I wanted to become a dentist and since then, I have shadowed three different offices. One was an orthodontist internship, another was me shadowing a pediatric dentist, and another one was me shadowing a general dentist. Each of these experiences motivate me to become a dentist and allow me to peer into the view of an actual dentist in the real world. Not only have I shadowed, but I am also part of a club called PDS which stands for Pre- Dental Society. Each school usually has one of these clubs! I have been apart of that club and not only that, but I am also going to start schooling in the next few weeks. When I say schooling I am referring to becoming a dental assistant as an undergraduate student. I want to do this so that I can gain more experience in becoming a dentist and also fully confirm that dentistry is what I want to do with my life. <br><br>

        Ever since I was younger, I wanted to be a veterinarian. But then once I grew more and started college I became pre-med and wanted to become a doctor just like my dad. Then, I started to think more and decided I wanted to give something new a try. When I say new I mean something that I am not extremely familiar with. Growing up with my dad, I have learned a lot about the medical field and how the process goes and I am very comfortable with that process. However, dentistry seemed so interesting to me and I had to give it a shot. I went and have gotten a little experience and now will be working in the field by next school year! I also need to do research at my school and get my degree in biology before I will be able to apply to dental school. I have much more shadowing ahead of me and working to do in order to pursue the career path that I want but the motivation of other dentists who have allowed me to go into their workspace and learn about their daily lives has kept me going so far and will hopefully allow me to reach my goal in the future.<br><br>

        Before I decided to become a dentist, I was able to go into the UCR medical school and volunteer in the anatomy lab there. That was a very cool experience and I was able to learn about the lives of medical students as well. Not only that, but I was able to learn more about the body as I was able to see the cadavers when the students worked on them. This not only helped me with the medical side of careers but also with dentistry as well. I was able to learn about the face.
